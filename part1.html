  <li> <div class="question">
   Q: O(n + 10)
  </div><div class="answer">
   A: O(n)
  </div> <div class="description">
    Description:
    In the expression O(n + 10), the constant term (10) becomes insignificant as the input size (n) grows large. Therefore, it simplifies to O(n), indicating linear time complexity.
  </div>
</li>
  <li> <div class="question">
    O(100 * n)
  </div><div class="answer">
    O(n)
  </div> <div class="description">
    Description: In the expression O(100 * n), the constant factor (100) becomes insignificant as the input size (n) grows large. Therefore, it simplifies to O(n), indicating linear time complexity.
  </div>

</li>
  <li> <div class="question">
  Q: O(25)
  </div><div class="answer">
  A: O(1)
  </div> <div class="description">
  Description:  In this case, it's constant time complexity, commonly denoted as O(1). It indicates that regardless of the input size, the algorithm's runtime remains constant.
  </div>

</li>
  <li> <div class="question">
  Q:  O(n^2 + n^3)
  </div><div class="answer">
  A:  O(n^3)
  </div> <div class="description">
  Description: Since n^3 grows faster than n^2 as the input size increases, it becomes the dominant term. Therefore, it is expressed as O(n^3).  
  </div>

</li>
  <li> <div class="question">
  Q:  O(n + n + n + n)
  </div><div class="answer">
  A: O(n)
  </div> <div class="description">
  Description: O(n + n + n + n) simplifies to O(4n). However, constants are disregarded in Big O notation, so it further simplifies to O(n). Therefore, the value is O(n).
  </div>

</li>
  <li> <div class="question">
  Q:  O(1000 * log(n) + n)
  </div><div class="answer">
  A: O(n)
  </div> <div class="description">
  Description: "1000 * log(n)" may seem large due to the constant factor, it is outweighed by the linear term "n" as "n" dominates the growth rate, especially for large values of "n".

  Therefore, we simplify the expression to O(n), indicating that the time complexity of the algorithm is primarily determined by its linear operations as the input size increases. 
  </div>

</li>
  <li> <div class="question">
    Q: O(1000 * n * log(n) + n)
  </div><div class="answer">
    A:   O(n*log(n))
  </div> <div class="description">
    Description:we focus on the dominant term "1000 * n * log(n)" and remove constants, simplifying it to O(n * log(n)).
  </div>

</li>
  <li> <div class="question">
  Q:  O(2^n + n^2)
  </div><div class="answer">
  A:  O(2^n)
  </div> <div class="description">
  Description:  In this expression, "2^n" grows much faster than "n^2" as the input size increases. This is because exponential growth (2^n) accelerates significantly faster than quadratic growth (n^2).

Therefore, as the input size becomes sufficiently large, the term "2^n" will dominate the overall time complexity. Hence, the expression can be simplified to O(2^n) to represent its worst-case time complexity.

  <li> <div class="question">
    O(5 + 3 + 1)
  </div><div class="answer">
    A: O(1)
  </div> <div class="description">
    O(5 + 3 + 1) simplifies to O(9). However, in Big O notation, constants are ignored. Therefore, the final simplified expression is O(1).
  </div>

</li>
  <li> <div class="question">
    O(n + n^(1/2) + n^2 + n * log(n)^10)
  </div><div class="answer">
    O(n * log(n)^10)
  </div> <div class="description">
    the term with the highest growth rate is n * log(n)^10
  </div>
